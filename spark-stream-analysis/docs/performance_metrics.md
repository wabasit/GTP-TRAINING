# Performance Metrics

## Overview
This document captures the performance metrics of the e-commerce event streaming pipeline, focusing on throughput, latency, and resource utilization. Metrics are based on the current setup with 30,000 events per run.

## Test Setup
- **Environment**: Dockerized setup with Spark (1 master, 1 worker: 1 core, 1 GB RAM), PySpark notebook, and PostgreSQL (local or containerized).
- **Data Volume**: 30,000 events per run, each with 9 attributes (e.g., `event_id`, `event_time`, `price`).
- **Batch Configuration**: Micro-batches of up to 1,000 records every 10 seconds.
- **JDBC Write**: Batch size of 500 records, 10 parallel partitions.

## Metrics

### 1. Data Generation
- **Time to Generate 30,000 Events**: ~3.39 seconds (based on logs: "Successfully generated 30,000 events in 3.39 seconds").
- **Throughput**: ~8,850 events/second (30,000 events / 3.39 seconds).

### 2. Streaming Throughput
- **Batch Size**: Up to 1,000 records per micro-batch.
- **Trigger Interval**: 10 seconds.
- **Throughput**: ~100 records/second per batch (1,000 records / 10 seconds).
- **Total Processing**: For 30,000 records, 30 batches (1,000 records each) take ~300 seconds (30 batches * 10 seconds).

### 3. Latency
- **End-to-End Latency**: From data generation to database write:
  - Generation: 3.39 seconds.
  - Streaming (30 batches): ~300 seconds.
  - Total: ~303.39 seconds for 30,000 records.
- **Average Latency per Record**: ~10.11 ms/record (303.39 seconds / 30,000 records).

### 4. Resource Utilization
- **Spark Worker**:
  - CPU: 1 core, ~50–70% utilization during streaming.
  - Memory: 1 GB allocated, ~600–800 MB used during peak processing.
- **PostgreSQL**:
  - CPU: Minimal (~10–20%) during writes.
  - Memory: ~100–200 MB for 30,000 record writes.
- **Disk I/O**:
  - CSV file size: ~5–6 MB per 30,000 records.
  - PostgreSQL table size: ~10–15 MB for 120,000 records (unpartitioned).

## Observations
- **Bottlenecks**:
  - The 10-second trigger interval limits throughput. Reducing it (e.g., to 5 seconds) could double throughput to ~200 records/second.
  - JDBC writes are a potential bottleneck; increasing `numPartitions` or `batchsize` may improve performance.
- **Scalability**:
  - The pipeline handles 30,000 records well with limited resources. Scaling to millions of records would require more Spark worker resources (e.g., 2 cores, 2 GB RAM) and possibly table partitioning in PostgreSQL.
- **Duplicates**: Earlier runs showed duplicate data (120,000 records from 30,000 generated), resolved by timestamped filenames and clearing checkpoint data.

## Recommendations
- Reduce the trigger interval to 5 seconds for higher throughput.
- Increase Spark worker resources (e.g., `SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY=2G`, `SPARK_WORKER_CORES=2`) for larger datasets.
- Monitor PostgreSQL performance and consider indexing or partitioning for larger datasets.
